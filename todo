improvement -> 'Class Api OSRSBox'
    - class should be very similar to runelite's
        - caching the monsters-complete.json file until the day after its updated on thursday
    - get all mobs with a drop table
    - get all drop table drops
    - get all drop table names -> use to debug DROP_TABLE._TablesRenaming()

improvement -> 'Class Retrieve' 'RETRIEVE_ALL' -> combine 'download all' functions
    RETRIEVE_ALL.DropTables(), RETRIEVE_ALL.MobImages(), RETRIEVE_ALL.DropTables() etc.

improvement -> use the fact that you can #Include files anywhere in the script 
    instead of having some weird code inside the 'FileInstall' file only have fileinstalls
    and write a Setup() function inside the main script

improvement -> Use msgbox lib/func

improvement -> refactor every file
    more descriptive class methods, variables, function names
    better code structure
        possibly nest / extend some classes
    remove duplicate code

learn -> How does osrsbox api assign the correct item id's for weird items like:
    Bronze key (H.A.M.)
    Iron key Bronze key (H.A.M.)
