bug > drop_log.load() does not detect damaged json files

optimize > test the program using tick count function/class
    large drop logs
        it should be possible to get really close to instant updates even at 100k lines by reducing loops, a lot
            possibly make a separate stats class so theres 'room' for plenty of methods
    incorrect or no data for the external apis
    which processes take up the most amount of load time, reduce those -- check speed different with/without SetBatchLines -1
        pretty slow update onto log gui after selecting a custom quantity through quantity gui

refactoring
    watch onenote refactor videos for inspiration
    eliminate global vars

refactor > settings
    every setting key should be added, possibly with empty value, right from the start
    dont reference setting object in code, instead pull variable from settings and use that
        ^ why? it seems like a good idea but im wrecked right now at 07:15 after waking up at around 01:00 for no reason
            ^ check how 'AutoGUI' handles this

feature > 'advanced' images
    gdip idea draft
        get high res large wiki image > scale to set size > add in center of set size canvas > profit
            this should work for mobs & drop images
            if this works retrieve all images to project same with runelite imgs now

    feature > mob images
        process mob and item images to be perfectly scaled, centered and bordered

                also supports adding border to image, which is exactly what i need for item images < see last comment:

            WIA library by 'just me' -- WIA_StampImage() should also allow to add an identifier icon to 'custom quantity' images

                download image from runelite api
                center image on canvas
                add border around canvas
                for multi quantity drops, add marking to top left of the image eg: '*'
    feature > stackable item icons > manually create these images and set them with code
        note
            sliiiight issues:
                items are named differently in the drop table and other pages eg. '/w/Ancient_Wyvern' mentions 'Seaweed spore' whereas '/w/Seeds' has Giant seaweed
                    could be a reason to manually make a list with item names and fetch (high) res images from the wiki
                very not future proof way, instead try automatically downloading them
