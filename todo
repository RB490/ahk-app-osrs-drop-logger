feature > stackable item icons > manually create these images and set them with code
    note
        sliiiight issues:
            items are named differently in the drop table and other pages eg. '/w/Ancient_Wyvern' mentions 'Seaweed spore' whereas '/w/Seeds' has Giant seaweed
                could be a reason to manually make a list with item names and fetch (high) res images from the wiki
            very not future proof way, instead try automatically downloading them

    ammo - arrows/darts/bolts, etc - darts(tips) do not have a bigger icon

feature > main gui > modify mob select to look like it did in 'rewrite 1'?, example is in /info/
    + feature > gui new preset
        preset name + drop log file (use scaling from WIA library by 'just me') + drop log mob
        position: could write 'show under mouse' option to local gui class, and use it for presets + integer input

optimize > test the program using tick count function/class
    large drop logs
        it should be possible to get really close to instant updates even at 100k lines by reducing loops, a lot
            possibly make a separate stats class so theres 'room' for plenty of methods
    incorrect or no data for the external apis
    which processes take up the most amount of load time, reduce those -- check speed different with/without SetBatchLines -1
        pretty slow update onto log gui after selecting a custom quantity through quantity gui

refactoring
    watch onenote refactor videos for inspiration
    eliminate global vars
    refactor > settings
        every setting key should be added, possibly with empty value, right from the start
        dont reference setting object in code, instead pull variable from settings and use that
            ^ why? it seems like a good idea but im wrecked right now at 07:15 after waking up at around 01:00 for no reason
                ^ check how 'AutoGUI' handles this

        ResConImg() : https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=2505
            also supports adding border to image, which is exactly what i need for item images < see last comment:
                https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/51035-add-border-on-images/
        WIA library by 'just me' -- WIA_StampImage() should also allow to add an identifier icon to 'custom quantity' images

            download image from runelite api
            center image on canvas
            add border around canvas
            for multi quantity drops, add marking to top left of the image eg: '*'
