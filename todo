bug -> 
    'Goblin Raider' monster with a drop table but without a picture that is removed from the game
    'Spinolyp' monster with a drop table and with a picture but its hidden behind a button
    test:
        retrieve class
        get drop table

improvement -> Setup(): use the fact that you can #Include files anywhere in the script 
    instead of having some weird code inside the 'FileInstall' file only have fileinstalls
    and write a Setup() function inside the main script

improvement -> refactor every file
    more descriptive class methods, variables, function names
    better code structure
        possibly nest / extend some classes
    remove duplicate code

learn -> How does osrsbox api assign the correct item id's for weird items like:
    Bronze key (H.A.M.)
    Iron key Bronze key (H.A.M.)
