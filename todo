bug > gui log enter hotkey does not add kill drops

feature > progress class gui? to prevent showing and closing a bunch of splashtext windows
    could have identical input to splashbox for ease of use

feature > convert osrsbox api downloadallimages() into a test class or something like that
    maybe just osrsbox api or download class

feature > idea > use item id's everywhere
    add them in wiki class
    use them in stats class
    use them when calling runelite class etc

Create download all mob drop tables function similar to DownloadMissingItemImages() to debug

refactor > eliminate global vars

refactor > go through every file
    more descriptive class methods, variables, function names
        eg. DROP_TABLE.LoadMob instead of .Get() or something
    better code structure
        possibly nest / extend some classes
    remove duplicate code

compile > need script to create \res\ fileInstall *i include file

-------------------------- Notes --------------------------
refactor > 'inspiration'
    watch onenote refactor videos
    check 'algumist' AutoGUI code
    check 'other-good-autohotkey-coders-code'

todo > create 'best autohotkey practices' rules file
    - naming schemes for functions, variables, global variables etc.
    - if statements formatting
    - include used libaries inside the scripts folder
    - do settings with ini? < add reason why if so
    - etc.
