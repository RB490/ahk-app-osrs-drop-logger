bug > right now it takes way to long for drop_table.get to check if images exist on disk

bug > DownloadMissingItemImages() sometimes hangs on 'hellpupy' 'Could not find 'inventory-image' class' for no reason, but after restarting the script its fine
    ^ doesnt seem to always do this

feature > reduce startup time aka the time to reach auto execute
    create new classes/load global vars after gui main starts up or some shit

feature > add setting for item icon type

refactor > more descriptive class methods
    eg. DROP_TABLE.LoadMob instead of .Get() or something

refactor > eliminate global vars

refactor > use good Libaries
    AutoXYWH()
        Use for resizable guis aka stats
        Make gui log resizable using this libary? would get rid of a bunch of settings
            If this not feasible, maybe allow resizing of the log gui
    Updated Gui Class?
        Or no maybe gui class at all

-------------------------- Notes --------------------------
refactor > 'inspiration'
    watch onenote refactor videos
    check 'algumist' AutoGUI code
    check 'other-good-autohotkey-coders-code'

todo > create 'best autohotkey practices' rules file
    - naming schemes for functions, variables, global variables etc.
    - if statements formatting
    - include used libaries inside the scripts folder
    - do settings with ini? < add reason why if so
    - etc.
