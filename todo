wiki class
    mob > retrieve drop tables in their categories, merging duplicate categories such as in black demons

drop table 'dtable' class
    download all images in a drop table

gui class 'logger'
    drops tab control: create a new tab for each drop table category
    edit drop log control: on the right of side the tabs, offset to tab position
    edit selected drops control: on the bottom the tabs, offset to tab position

revert/undo wiki class changes > upload to private github repo > commit each new change to github repo

merge duplicate drop tables eg. for 'black demon' in wiki get

retrieve item object from gui log on mouse click
    different drop tables can contain the same item with different quantities,
    assign variable to item image to be retrieved with MouseGetPos containing,
    item name and occurence, then search drop log object with found occurence to get the exact item
    this does require log gui to use the same object as the drop log class


the drop table class method that sends information to the logger gui:
    - combine categories below X drops so there are no useless tabs with a small amount of drops
    - if the total amount of drops is lower then X combine them. ignoring the rare drop table

use wiki class to retrieve links to high res images for dropTables.GetImages()

handle gui log tab3 not scaling properly, happened recently can compare older working versions to debug

drop table class refactoring
    use this.obj in every class without passing or returning it OR pass it and return it
    possibly rename methods to be cleaner
    check function descriptions

wiki class refactoring


drop log class
    write it so it can support trips, deaths obviously drops and also UNDO/REDO
    UNDO/REDO
        before making any change, save an entire copy of the object, and use this to undo/redo as normal

        obj.clone() copies the key-value pairs into a new object, but since i use objects it copies the references to the object,
        this is called a 'shallow' copy' need a deep copy function or write files to disk and json load etc,
        though that seems really ineficient especially with large files

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ completed ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

integrate drop log gui and drop log class

handle multiple items with different quantities after merging eg. 'adamanite bar' or 'coins' for black demons
    per table, merge them into one drop with all quantities combined with a separator so they can individually be used

separate images in log gui
    could be done by adding white space to image file, wiki might have a feature for this <IT DOESNT...>
    could be done by first adding an image control with a border and then a smaller image control inside that with the image in it
    could be done by retrieving the item from the grand exchange - up to date item ids can be found
        @ https://github.com/runelite/runelite/blob/master/runelite-api/src/main/java/net/runelite/api/ItemID.java
        these images have white space in them by default
        if no valid image is on the grand exchange try wiki high detail method otherwise use the html icon
        apparently osrs has a ge api? https://github.com/Chasesc/OSRS-API-Wrapper
        whip = http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/api/catalogue/detail.json?item=4151
        note, sometimes the api does not load, or is slow..

gui class for selecting a mob and file
    option to add mobs to a list control that is filled with a few defaults
    option to search list control
    display image of currently selected mob
    store logged mob between sessions

optimizing
    test the program
        - which processes take up the most amount of load time, reduce those
        - large drop logs
    
    bulk file download
    goal: function that calls separate script file to download files (images) quickly,
        use this in the drop table class to get images fast
