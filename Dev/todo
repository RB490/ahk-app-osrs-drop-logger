FEATURES -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    feature -> ON_WM_LBUTTONDOWN -> quantity select gui

    feature -> instead of showing the entire mob list in the start gui show  a 'favourites' list mobs can be added to and removed from
        listview using the mob images
    
    feature -> try center align runelite images or close as possible
        cut 4 pixels off to the right as they are 32x36
        or try something along those lines

    drop categories
        feature -> drop categories -> separate the rare drop table and the others like gem drop table from the main drop table
            ^ seems atleast by checking vorkath the rare drop table isn't included. So always include the RDT into the gui,
                either as a tab or an image that opens a separate gui

        feature -> drop categories -> take max drop table variable into account
            if the drops list is above X, start adding items into categories until it is no longer above X
                ^ first get all the item category sizes to determine which to start with
                start with separating the largest category OR the one that gets the nearest below X
                this prevents item categories with very few items

    feature idea -> Update ClassMobDatabase._Update() in the background so it doesn't take 20 seconds
        ^ it's only once a week though

    feature -> speed up item db load time? would be able to do this with an item name:id list of the items
        that are actually in drop tables and only storing necessary item prices
            wiki api = instant
            item db = 0.200
            mob db = 0.04

STRUCTURE ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
    bug -> stats -> unique drop shortest dry streak and longest dry streak are empty if only gotten once. though the

    bug -> whenever log gui is shown also refetch the drop table so changes are taken into accoutn. for example after changing settings
        specifically putting the drop table in specific categories setting

    bug -> gui_log -> menu open drop log file, windows doesnt open the .json for some reason

DOLAST ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    refactoring -> go through every file and if necessary add comments, rename stuff or whatever

    testing -> log a variety of mobs with different drop tables to adjust the categories and or add additional categories
