planning -> item categories -> if a drop table needs to be reduced
    - go through each category and make a list of how many hits the drop table has in each category. for example 5 herbs 3 farming stuff 10 equipment
    - use that list to determine which items should go into a separate category to prevent having categories of 1 or 2 items while the drop table might have 10 equipment
        ^ either go with the largest category or the lowest amount while still meeting the main drop table max limit
