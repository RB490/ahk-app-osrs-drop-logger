FEATURES -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    drop categories
        feature -> drop categories -> separate the rare drop table and the others like gem drop table from the main drop table
            ^ seems atleast by checking vorkath the rare drop table isn't included. So always include the RDT into the gui,
                either as a tab or an image that opens a separate gui


STRUCTURE ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------       
    bug -> whenever log gui is shown also refetch the drop table so changes are taken into accoutn. for example after changing settings
        specifically putting the drop table in specific categories setting

    unique drops
        might just rewrite the unique drops method from scratch here
            bug -> stats -> current dry streak doesnt seem to be right, either
            bug -> stats -> unique drop shortest dry streak and longest dry streak are empty if only gotten once
            bug -> stats -> unique drop cadantine dry streak stays at 1 even adding a lot of other drops

DOLAST ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    refactoring -> go through every file and if necessary add comments, rename stuff or whatever

    testing -> log a variety of mobs with different drop tables to adjust the categories and or add additional categories
