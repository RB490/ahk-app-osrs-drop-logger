create database file with mobName:id using monsters-complete.jsonhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrsbox/osrsbox-db/master/docs/monsters-complete.json
create database file with itemName:id using https://www.osrsbox.com/osrsbox-db/items-summary.json
^ update these once a week on friday or whenever the script runs after that friday

maybe use id:mobName and id:itemName instead?

^ replace mob_list / mob_info



ideas
    Save the mobs and their update time to preventie udating eithout cause

    And use the mob list time stamps to check when it was updated

    Idea: use starting out db and add to it. Eg for item and mob ids to save time. Keep the existing mobs:ids. Downside is the main mob menu wouldnt have the new ones i guess
