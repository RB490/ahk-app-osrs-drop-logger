todo -> LOG_GUI

planning -> item categories -> if a drop table needs to be divided into categories
    - go through each category and make a list of how many hits the drop table has in each category. for example 5 herbs 3 farming stuff 10 equipment
    - use that list to determine which items should go into a separate category to prevent having categories of 1 or 2 items while the drop table might have 10 equipment
        ^ either go with the largest category or the lowest amount while still meeting the main drop table max limit

feature idea -> Update ClassMobDatabase._Update() in the background so it doesn't take 20 seconds

wiki api ->
    todo -> rename ClassApiWiki to something like ClassWiki or ClassWikiScraper because it doesn't actually use the wiki api which is conflicting. it's my wiki 'api'
    feature -> add more documentation. class/method and their parameter(s) descriptions 
        eg. its not clear what the input parameter(s) are for GetMobImage
    bug ->  getmob image can't retrieve image for spinolyp
        the wiki page infobox for this mob has 'suspicious water' preselected instead of the actual spinolyp which is probably messing the script up
