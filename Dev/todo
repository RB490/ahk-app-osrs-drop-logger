todo -> start with the start gui
    + do i want to display all npcs or individually add npc's
        fun fact: now that we don't have duplicates just get the npc id by searching
    - go through gui start's methods from top to bottom making them functional
        - MobListBoxHandler: add settings to the script and save the gui start selected mob

planning -> item categories -> if a drop table needs to be reduced
    - go through each category and make a list of how many hits the drop table has in each category. for example 5 herbs 3 farming stuff 10 equipment
    - use that list to determine which items should go into a separate category to prevent having categories of 1 or 2 items while the drop table might have 10 equipment
        ^ either go with the largest category or the lowest amount while still meeting the main drop table max limit

feature idea -> Update ClassMobDatabase._Update() in the background so it doesn't take 20 seconds
