todo -> item categories -> LOG_GUI

feature -> separate the rare drop table and the others like gem drop table from the main drop table

feature idea -> Update ClassMobDatabase._Update() in the background so it doesn't take 20 seconds

wiki api ->
    todo -> rename ClassApiWiki to something like ClassWiki or ClassWikiScraper because it doesn't actually use the wiki api which is conflicting. it's my wiki 'api'
    feature -> add more documentation. class/method and their parameter(s) descriptions 
        eg. its not clear what the input parameter(s) are for GetMobImage
    bug ->  getmob image can't retrieve image for spinolyp
        the wiki page infobox for this mob has 'suspicious water' preselected instead of the actual spinolyp which is probably messing the script up

testing -> log a variety of mobs with different drop tables to adjust the categories and or add additional categories

feature -> speed up item db load time? would be able to do this with an item name:id list of the items that are actually in drop tables
    ^ or sear
    wiki api = instant
    item db = 0.200
    mob db = 0.04

structure -> merge drop table categories class into the drop table class like done with the wiki api
