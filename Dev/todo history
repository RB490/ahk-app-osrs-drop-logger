ideas
    Save the mobs and their update time to preventie udating eithout cause

    Use the mob list time stamps to check when it was updated

    Instead of recreating the entire database add missing entries to it


create database file with mobName:id using monsters-complete.jsonhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrsbox/osrsbox-db/master/docs/monsters-complete.json
create database file with itemName:id using https://www.osrsbox.com/osrsbox-db/items-summary.json
^ update these once a week on friday or whenever the script runs after that friday

maybe use id:mobName and id:itemName instead?

handle mob database failure to reach the url

structure -> create database with mob names,id's and last change date from monsters-complete
    use the osrsbox mobName:lastChangeDate file (eg. retrieved every friday) to compare the lastChangeDate in the database
    if the lastChangeDate differes, or the entry doesn't yet exist 
    update the database and download the new file into a separate folder
    this way the database file stays at a small file size
    ^ if the mob name is not yet in the database i guess you'd have to
        - download an entirely new monsters-complete.json
        - use the osrsbox.com search npc id website, write some kind of com wrapper thing to search the mob id
            Take into account that sometimes there are multiple results 
            even though only one is valid. Eg: Typhor 9295 and Typhor 9296 where you want 9296 as 9295 shows an error
        - npc id's are also saved on the wiki page info box even though they're not displayed. under 'Monster ID</th><td colspan="18">9295,9296</td></tr><tr'
    outputObj[mob_id].wiki_url := inputObj[mob_id].wiki_url
    outputObj[mob_id].category := inputObj[mob_id].category
    outputObj[mob_id].drops := inputObj[mob_id].drops
    ^^^^^
        NOTE: For some reason a lot of the timestamps in the monsters-wiki-page-titles.json are already not identical to monsters-complete
        so.. another idea would be to just retrieve an entire new monsters-complete and create a fresh database with that once a day or whatever interval. But do it in the background
            for example by running a separate script. this way you can just compare the timestamps from the individual npc files to the main database
            or with a SetTimer, like i think the stats update thing uses. as long as it doesnt hang the script

debug -> download the entire monsters-complete thing and see how large the file gets. possibly have to store drops separately or not at all
    ^ 15 MB. Definetly handle this differently

bug -> the mob database class opens two progress guis and closes two of them, if updating. the second time the progress gui gets closed there is an error message

feature -> remove duplicate mobs from the database

settings arent saving because the object inside of the settings class doesnt get modified by writing script_settings.key := value

todo -> start with the start gui
    + do i want to display all npcs or individually add npc's
        fun fact: now that we don't have duplicates just get the npc id by searching
    - go through gui start's methods from top to bottom making them functional
        + MobListBoxHandler(): add settings to the script and save the gui start selected mob
        + BtnLog()

feature -> download mob images in drop table class

todo -> write retrieve function automatically retrieve the drop table for every mob in the database and thereby also downloading the mob and drop images
