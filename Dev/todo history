    Save the mobs and their update time to preventie udating eithout cause

    Use the mob list time stamps to check when it was updated

    Instead of recreating the entire database add missing entries to it


create database file with mobName:id using monsters-complete.jsonhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrsbox/osrsbox-db/master/docs/monsters-complete.json
create database file with itemName:id using https://www.osrsbox.com/osrsbox-db/items-summary.json
^ update these once a week on friday or whenever the script runs after that friday

maybe use id:mobName and id:itemName instead?
