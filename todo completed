wiki class
    mob > retrieve drop tables in their categories, merging duplicate categories such as in black demons

drop table 'dtable' class
    download all images in a drop table

gui class 'logger'
    drops tab control: create a new tab for each drop table category
    edit drop log control: on the right of side the tabs, offset to tab position
    edit selected drops control: on the bottom the tabs, offset to tab position

revert/undo wiki class changes > upload to private github repo > commit each new change to github repo

merge duplicate drop tables eg. for 'black demon' in wiki get

retrieve item object from gui log on mouse click
    different drop tables can contain the same item with different quantities,
    assign variable to item image to be retrieved with MouseGetPos containing,
    item name and occurence, then search drop log object with found occurence to get the exact item
    this does require log gui to use the same object as the drop log class

the drop table class method that sends information to the logger gui:
    - combine categories below X drops so there are no useless tabs with a small amount of drops
    - if the total amount of drops is lower then X combine them. ignoring the rare drop table

use wiki class to retrieve links to high res images for DROP_TABLEs.GetImages()

handle gui log tab3 not scaling properly, happened recently can compare older working versions to debug

drop table class refactoring
    use this.obj in every class without passing or returning it OR pass it and return it
    possibly rename methods to be cleaner
    check function descriptions

wiki class refactoring

drop log class
    write it so it can support trips, deaths obviously drops and also UNDO/REDO
    UNDO/REDO
        before making any change, save an entire copy of the object, and use this to undo/redo as normal

        obj.clone() copies the key-value pairs into a new object, but since i use objects it copies the references to the object,
        this is called a 'shallow' copy' need a deep copy function or write files to disk and json load etc,
        though that seems really ineficient especially with large files

integrate drop log gui and drop log class
    start trip > add some drops > undo some drops > add more drops > redo > BUG
        something with a link between 'this.changes' and 'this.undonechanges'
        could look at how clips manager does this?
    how to handle all the different 'cases' eg. user tries to start new death   
        without a trip currently active
    apply checks when ending trip
        death should be ended

add example of small drop log containing every aspect, trip, kill with a single or multiple drops deaths etc.

log gui separate drop images
    source overview
        grand exchange > good icons with white space > does not contain all icons
            ge api > heavily throttled
            ge html > heavily throttled
            osrsbox png > off center
            osrsbox api > useless base64 encode string
        wiki > does not have white space
        runelite > contains all icons including whitespace but off-center, might be able to fix with code
            
    info
        example ge api call for whip = http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/api/catalogue/detail.json?item=4151
        up-to-date item ids: https://github.com/runelite/runelite/blob/master/runelite-api/src/main/java/net/runelite/api/ItemID.java
        example runelite api call for coins = HTTPS://api.runelite.net/runelite-1.6.19/cache/item/998/image

    issues
        ge does not have links to untradable items like 'clue scroll (hard)', 'larran's key'. but osrsbox api does have these icons? how?
            it gets them from the runelite api: https://static.runelite.net/api/http-service/

    solution
        fetch all large & small icon images from the ge and include them in the repo, then add missing images with the same function whenever needed
        fetch everything
            ge small
            ge large
            wiki small icon
            wiki high res
        just use runelite's images - include all of them and download missing ones

cleanup / refactor the complete mess that is this code right now after ^

wiki class > modify user input for wiki class inside the wiki class using a method

gui class for selecting a mob and file
    feature
        option to add mobs to a list control that is filled with a few defaults
        option to search list control
        display image of currently selected mob
        store logged mob between sessions
    functionality
        open drop log file with drop log class
        show log gui

separate runelite class 'item id' stuff and 'api' stuff? same for wiki with getimgurl and the table things

completely rewrite drop table class, check total lines before and after

update example files

drop log > combine item quantities
    some items appear multiple times per table with different quantities eg. 'coins' in 'black demon' or 'goblin'
        combine them. but quantities need to be preserved
    varierty of different quantity formats eg.
        1
        N/A
        3,000
        250–499
        20,000–81,000
        ^ <quantity> + ' (noted)'

weird wiki dash '-' thing is converted to gibberish in autohotkey making it difficult to use functins like SubStr()

OnWM_LBUTTONDOWN > handle a variety of different item quantities
    examples
        1
        N/A
        3,000
        250–499
        20,000–81,000
        ^ <quantity> + ' (noted)'
        ...and some items will have a combination of these
    show multiple guis or a single gui with input styles for each quantity:
        1 = 1 button
        range between X eg. 15 show 15 buttons
        range above X eg. 15 show edit control, possibly pre-loaded with lowest or middle range value
        range above X eg. 15 show slider control, with lowest and highest range values
        possible solution = show edit control always and add buttons after that

bug gui log > select a drop > select the same drop right after > no response, why this delay?
    solution: something to do with how microsoft coded WM_LBUTTONDOWN(), if you click in different spots on the image its fine

ClassGuiQuantity > disable LOG_GUI while its open

feature > loading and saving drop logs

bug > 'black demon' drop log main tab choose addy bar, edit field is set to 0

refactor > ClassGuiQuantity

feature > achieve feature parity with older versions. check older versions  eg. add current trip information (in the program title or somewhere else)

gui log
    feature > status bar with current mob & drop log file? though its already in the mob gui
    feature > create a nice layout once all the necessary components are functional
                - combine buttons eg. start death can change into end death and ending a trip
                while death is active should automatically end the death
                - size & position buttons based on how often theyre used
                    +kill
                    new trip
                    start/end trip
                    start/end death
                    undo
                    redo
                    
save snippet working example from: https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=30979

refactor global variables into caps lock with underscores eg:

clear drops when starting/ stopping trip

bug > prevent kills from being logged while dead

disable everything on the gui except death toggle button, when dead

drop log.get()
    feature > add ---trip #<tripnumber>--- dividers between trips in drop log.get()
    feature > add space between drops in drop log.get()
    feature > add ---death--- divider between in drop log.get()
        log the time of each individual drop aswell and then create an object
        with key:value where key is all the timestamps so they automatically
        get organized on the correct time
            bug > 'new trip' writes tripEnd and new tripStart in the same second so input is lost
                encode + decode timestring with function, add and remove <identifier> A_TickCount

gui log
    feature > show trip number, kill number and current trip duration in title bar
        ^ leave this in the stats gui
    feature > remember position
    bug > set log gui mimimum height, becomes way too 'short' with small drop tables like 'chicken'
    bug > log gui last item in a drop table clips over the row above it

mob aka 'main' gui
    refactoring > rename mob gui to something more descriptive because it has multiple purposes:
        selecting a mob
        selecting a drop log
        choosing a preset which selects the two above

feature > drop log class > choosing drop log file that does not exist > ask to create file

feature > gui log small settings menu button with icon
    guiLog - item size
    guiLog - row width
    gui about
        github repo
        some usefull information about the program, maybe how it functions, dependencies runelite/osrs wiki

bug > manually change settings file to have invalid value for 'logGuiDropSize' or 'logGuiMaxRowDrops' > program error
    check imporant keys on program startup and restore them if needed
    LoadSettings()
        try to load settings file
            failure > set default settings
        check critical keys, key + value
            failure > set default settings

gui log > add proper icons

since the runelite item icons are transparent it might be possible to reize/move them with code inside an image control
    or try that GuiButtonIcon() which definetly allows for resizing
    https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/LoadPicture.htm
    GuiControl allows to set image inside picture control, resized

refactor > gui log > especially involving MAX_DROP_SIZE, 'logGuiDropSize' and SavePos() CheckPos()

refactor > LoadSettings / CheckCriticalSettings / LoadDefaultSettings this is messy
    load settings > load default settings for missing values

refactoring > runelite class also use prices file to find item ids? prevents encoding decoding to runelite java naming format

user has a main drop log where anything is logged > current loaded mob is 'black demon' > stats needs access to whip price
    add price support to RuneLiteApi https://api.runelite.net/runelite-1.6.20/item/prices
    split runelite api into multiple classes?
        RuneLiteApiIds
        RuneLiteApiPrice
        
stats item price lookup is slow, potential fix:
    adjust RUNELITE_API json format so items can be directly accessed rather than looped eg:
        RUNELITE_API.obj[<itemName>].id

combine collecting 'basic' stats into one loop? - though there doesnt seem to be a performance hit seperately looping through the object in multiple methods

stats
    feature > gui stats
        gui stats listview
            use formattime for time vars
            add comma dividers for profit vars
            which method to use for loading stats class data into stats gui listview
    feature > stats class

feature > integrate gui stats into gui log > use vertical lines hamburger icon vaguely representing osrs stats tab icon. or the actual icon in black & white 
    possibly also use this icon on the actual stats gui

feature > stats > 'unique' drop information aka same quantity + name:
    'drop quantity' x 'drop name' | total times dropped | total value | drop rate | kills since last drop | shorest dry streak | longest dry streak

feature > stop logging + save drop log > on log gui close (return to main gui) and on script close. also end trip and death if not done already:
    bug > stats > automatically end trip when stopping logging either because of gui close or script close
        this is to prevent a large amount of time between trip start & end time and thereby messing up stats

bug > runelite api url /item/prices/ does not include items without prices
    ^ when downloading api file, also download the item id definition file and add those to the obj,
        recover item name parsing code
        use runelite item naming scheme everywhere for clarity

refactoring > Add  short description to the top of every class

bug > gui log does not close

feature > bulk file download
    goal: function that calls separate script file to download files (images) quickly,
        use this in the drop table class to get images fast
            ^^ not doing this because runelite api is a limiting factor / even if its not thats abuse

figure out miliseconds and 'FormatTime': https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=64641

feature > Separate todo sections into multiple files

bug > log menu > 'delocalize' menu images

bug > main gui > remove 'x' > does not get removed, or does get removed but the gui isnt updated. also clear selected mob
